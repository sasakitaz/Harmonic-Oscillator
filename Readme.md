# What is this?
This program solves time independent Schrodinger equation of 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator. In 1D and 3D, you can include anharmonic terms.

## 1D-Anharmonicity_withIRspectrum.py
Solving 1-dimensional oscillator program. ex. HCl

This program has 2 potential parameter
- harmonic potential parameter: kzz
- anharmonic potential parameter: kzzz

This program also provides potential surface figure and IR spectrum

## 2D.py
Solving 2-dimensional oscillator program. 

## 3D-RadialAnharmonicity.py
Solving 3-dimensional oscillator program.

This program has 2 potential parameter
- harmonic potential parameter: kzz
- anharmonic potential parameter: kzzzz

By using function multipole(self, L, M, S) for L ≠ 0 and M ≠ 0, you can include not only radial anharmonic potential but also anisotropic potential.
